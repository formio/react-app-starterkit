# Form.io React App Starterkit

This template provides a minimal application that uses Form.io, React, and Vite.

## Get Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Keep in mind that, in order to stay up to date, this project uses GitHub dependency links. If you are using e.g. `yarn` v1, these will not work as intented and you'll need to either pin those dependencies to versions from the npm registry or move to using `npm`.
